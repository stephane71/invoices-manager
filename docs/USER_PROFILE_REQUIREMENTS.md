   - ✅ Full name (at least 2 characters)
   - ✅ Address with a comma (e.g., "Street, City")

### "Invalid address format" error?

Your address must contain a comma to separate the street from the city/postal code.

- **Seller identification**: Your name and address identify you as the seller

- **Payment information**: Facilitates payment processing

Invoices without this information may be considered invalid and could result in:
- Fiscal fines up to €15 per missing element
