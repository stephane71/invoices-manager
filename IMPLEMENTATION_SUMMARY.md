# Implementation Summary: Currency Selection Feature

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

All requirements from the issue have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ‚úÖ Currency field in user account
- Added `currency` field to the `Profile` type with EUR as default
- Profile API now accepts and stores currency preference
- Database migration provided in `MIGRATION_CURRENCY.sql`

### 2. ‚úÖ Currency select in user account page
- Added a styled dropdown in the profile page
- Currently displays "Euro (EUR)" as the only option
- Located between the "Address" and "Logo" fields
- Disabled when loading or saving
- Includes proper translations in English and French

### 3. ‚úÖ Handle user currency in invoice PDF generation
- PDF generation route now fetches user's currency preference
- Uses `profile?.currency || "EUR"` as fallback
- All prices in the PDF use the selected currency

### 4. ‚úÖ Handle user currency in the rest of the app
Updated all pages that display prices:
- **Invoices list page**: Shows totals with correct currency
- **Invoice detail page**: Shows all prices (total, item prices) with correct currency
- **New invoice page**: Shows total and item prices with correct currency
- **ArticlesBlock component**: Displays currency symbol in labels and placeholders

## üìù Before Deployment

**Important**: Run the database migration before deploying these changes:

1. Open your Supabase SQL editor
2. Copy and paste the contents of `MIGRATION_CURRENCY.sql`
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify the `currency` column was added to the `profiles` table

## üéØ User Experience

Users will see:
1. A new "Currency" field in their profile page
2. A dropdown with "Euro (EUR)" as the only option
3. All prices throughout the app displayed with the ‚Ç¨ symbol
4. PDF invoices generated with EUR formatting

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Key Files Modified:
- **Type definitions**: `src/types/models.ts`
- **API route**: `src/app/api/profile/route.ts`
- **Profile page**: `src/app/(app)/profil/page.tsx`
- **Invoice pages**: `src/app/(app)/invoices/page.tsx`, `[id]/page.tsx`, `new/page.tsx`
- **PDF generation**: `src/app/api/invoices/[id]/pdf/route.ts`
- **Components**: `src/components/invoices/ArticlesBlock.tsx`
- **Translations**: `messages/en.json`, `messages/fr.json`

### Approach:
- Minimal changes to existing code
- Used existing `numberToCurrency` utility for consistent formatting
- Added fallbacks to EUR if profile data is unavailable
- Maintained backward compatibility

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

To add more currencies:
1. Add new `<SelectItem>` entries in the profile page
2. No other code changes needed - the currency system is fully dynamic

Example:
```tsx
<SelectContent>
  <SelectItem value="EUR">Euro (EUR)</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="USD">US Dollar (USD)</SelectItem>
  <SelectItem value="GBP">British Pound (GBP)</SelectItem>
</SelectContent>
```
